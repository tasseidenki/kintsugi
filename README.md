Give your old Nintendo Switch a second chance with this consolizer kit
Don’t rush to recycle your old (non-OLED) Nintendo Switch – instead give it a second chance as a home console even if it’s screen is damaged and build-in controls no longer work.

![IMG_0653](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82fea9e5-15eb-4b2d-83d4-98aeefe136bd)

Main features: 

- proper home console-like experience (all ports where they should be);
- no battery (built-in 4.2V regulator);
- optional third-party features (like built-in controller adapters);
- four USB ports for your favorite accessories;

To build this, you need:
- Nintendo Switch (Lite or OLED won’t work); the screen and controller interface don’t matter;
- Official dock.

A few more things:
- 2x HS8836A USB hub ICs (aliexpress.com/item/1005003654793445.html)
- PTR08060WVD DC-DC converter (digikey.jp/ja/products/detail/texas-instruments/PTR08060WVD/1698955)
- Ribbon HDMI cable (male + female) (aliexpress.com/item/1005003777630816.html type A2/A3, A4);
- 6-pin Type-C connector;
- MicroSD card slot;
- 4x USB Type-A ports;
- optional: 4x 3rd-party wireless controller adapters (aliexpress.com/item/1005003614751572.html);
- 2x 220uf capacitors;
- 50V 0805;
- 1x 330R 0805 resistor;
- 4x 100nf 0805 capacitors; 
- 2x 1k 0805 resistors;
- 2x 4u7 0805 capacitors;
- 2x 100k resistors;
- 2x LEDs (blue / green);
- several 6x6 buttons.

How-to (main steps):

1. Salvage the main PCB along with the fan and whatever parts you want to reuse from the console;
2. Do the same for the dock PCB.
3. Solder all the components onto the main PCB and position the elements inside the shell as designated.
4. Align and connect the flex cables (including the ones from the Switch/Dock).
5. Solder extensions to the SD card and game card modules (be careful since they are super easy to break).
